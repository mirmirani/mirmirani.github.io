      <h5>About Me</h5>
      <p>I'm a self-taught dev and a UCL grad. A tech internship in Shanghai motivated me to start coding. You can learn more about me from the links to your right.</p>

      <p>For the Back-end I work with Python, Go and Django.
      While on the front I use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with SASS. </p>

      <p>
        These days, I am learning Go, TDD and Reactjs. I have a penchant for responsive design, and I am aiming to continuosly improve skills across my tech stack.

  <h1 id='learning-log'>Django: Learning Log</h1>
  <h5> 
    What is it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Learning Log is a personal journal jotter for anything you are learning which can be accessed online from anywhere. It allows you to make a personal user account and add topics and entries to record your learning.
    </p>
    <h5> 
    How was it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Creating this app was a good experience in getting to know more about the MVC model and OOP principles. It was eye-opening to learn how powerful of a framework Django really is and the capabilities of python.
    </p>
    <p>
    I ran into some bugs but Django comes with a very powerful debugging tool and I was able to overcome them by using Django’s documentation and stackoverflow. 
    </p>
    <h5>
     Future steps
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Django’s templating tool is indeed very powerful but I hope to get more familiar with using and customising widgets in the future. I also hope to learn CMS Wagtail for more smoother admin integration.

  <h1 id='quote-generator'>Vanilla Js: Quote Generator</h1>
  <h5> 
    What is it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Another pure javascript application that makes use of APIs, promises and JSON
    </p>
    <h5> 
    How was it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    It was fun working with APIs, though the quotes weren’t impactful enough for me
    </p>
    <h5> 
     Future steps
    </h5> 
    <p>
    Perhaps I could create my own API with quotes more suited to me and make it publicly available
    </p>
    


  <h1 id='street-fighter'>Vanilla Js: Rock, Paper, Scissors: Street Fighter</h1>
  <h5> 
    What is it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    This is a very simple javascript application, a classic Rock Paper Scissors games with a street fighter twist.
    </p>
    <h5> 
    How was it?
    </h5> 
    <p>
    The scripting was easy enough and overall the app was quick to make. However I was still getting used to responsive design and here the app still has some faults, it could be more mobile responsive.
    </p>
    <h5> 
     Future steps
    </h5> 
    <p>
    I intend to create more complex apps making use of more complex JS concepts.
